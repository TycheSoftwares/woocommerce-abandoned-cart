== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Lite and Pro version of the plugin? =

To see how the PRO version can help you recover more abandoned carts compared to Lite, you can refer **[here](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/differences-between-pro-and-lite-versions-of-abandoned-cart-for-woocommerce-plugin/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=faqlink&utm_campaign=AbandonedCartLite "Lite and Pro version Difference")**

= How is the email address of the customers captured? =

Our plugin captures visitor emails in real-time as they're typing it in to the email address field on the checkout page, so you don't need to worry about them changing their mind at the last second.

When logged-in user add the product to the cart we capture the email address from the user's profile.

= Can the plugin track carts abandoned by guest users? =

Yes, it captures the carts of the guest users from the checkout page. We capture the guest user's abandoned cart only after the customer enters the "Email Address" on the checkout page.

Also, plugin does capture the cart from the cart page, these carts do not have any personal information of the customers. It will contain only the cart details. To capture, this information guest customer should reach the cart page of the website.

= Why are abandoned cart notification emails not getting sent? =

Please ensure you have at least one Email template "Active". As only active email templates are sent to recover the abandoned carts. 

For sending the abandoned cart notification emails automatically, we use WP-Cron. If you have Email templates activated and still notification are not sent, then you can debug the issue by following this **[post](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/using-wp_alternate_cron-to-overcome-the-problem-of-emails-not-being-sent-in-abandoned-cart-pro-plugin-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=AbandonedCartLite "WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro")**.

= When is the cart considered as an abandoned cart? =

When the products in the cart is not purchased within the set 'Cart abandoned cut-off time' then the cart is considered as an abandoned cart.

= How to unsubscribe the abandoned cart notification emails? =

The admin can use the merge code `{{cart.unsubscribe}}' in the email templates. It will be replaced with a url in the abandoned cart email notification sent to the customer. When clicked, the reminder email notification for the particular email will be unsubscribed.

We have used microtime function & a security key. Using this security key, and after applying an algorithm on it, we generate the encoded string.

* The session now starts only on required pages of the store. Earlier it was started globally. This will help to improve the site performance.

* If billing email address of the logged-in user is not set then it was showing blank space on the abandoned orders list. This has been fixed. Now it will show the email address which was used while registering to the store.
