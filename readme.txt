== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Lite and Pro version of the plugin? =

To see how the PRO version can help you recover more abandoned carts compared to Lite, you can refer **[here](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/differences-between-pro-and-lite-versions-of-abandoned-cart-for-woocommerce-plugin/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=faqlink&utm_campaign=AbandonedCartLite "Lite and Pro version Difference")**

= How is the email address of the customers captured? =

Our plugin captures visitor emails in real-time as they're typing it in to the email address field on the checkout page, so you don't need to worry about them changing their mind at the last second.

When logged-in user add the product to the cart we capture the email address from the user's profile.

= Can the plugin track carts abandoned by guest users? =

Yes, it captures the carts of the guest users from the checkout page. We capture the guest user's abandoned cart only after the customer enters the "Email Address" on the checkout page.

Also, plugin does capture the cart from the cart page, these carts do not have any personal information of the customers. It will contain only the cart details. To capture, this information guest customer should reach the cart page of the website.

= Why are abandoned cart notification emails not getting sent? =

Please ensure you have at least one Email template "Active". As only active email templates are sent to recover the abandoned carts. 

For sending the abandoned cart notification emails automatically, we use WP-Cron. If you have Email templates activated and still notification are not sent, then you can debug the issue by following this **[post](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/using-wp_alternate_cron-to-overcome-the-problem-of-emails-not-being-sent-in-abandoned-cart-pro-plugin-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=AbandonedCartLite "WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro")**.

= When is the cart considered as an abandoned cart? =

When the products in the cart is not purchased within the set 'Cart abandoned cut-off time' then the cart is considered as an abandoned cart.

= How to unsubscribe the abandoned cart notification emails? =

The admin can use the merge code `{{cart.unsubscribe}}' in the email templates. It will be replaced with a url in the abandoned cart email notification sent to the customer. When clicked, the reminder email notification for the particular email will be unsubscribed.

This will improve the site performance.

= 3.1 (15.09.2016) =

* New Feature - The email sending logic has been changed. Due to some reason, the abandoned cart remainder emails are not sent to the customers at the time they are intended to be sent, and if after some time, the emails start sending, then multiple email templates whose interval has been reached were all sent together. Now, the plugin will also consider the last abandoned cart reminder email sent time and will keep a time gap between the last email template that was sent & the current email template's time, thereby ensuring emails are not sent together.

* Bug Fixed - The "Alter" table queries have been changed in the plugin. Instead of using get_results(), it now uses the query().

* Bug Fixed - We have used the encryption libraries mcrypt_encrypt, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 to generate the cart links sent in the abandoned cart reminder emails. Due to this on some servers where these libraries were not enabled, the abandoned cart email notification were not sent to the recipients. This has been fixed.

* Bugs Fixed - Earlier the abandoned cart reminder emails & abandoned orders details page was not displaying the selected attributes for the variable products. This has been fixed.

* Bugs Fixed - The "Abandoned Date" column of the abandoned orders tab was not considering the time for sorting. This has been fixed.

= 2.9 (05.07.2016) =

* New Feature - New merge tag {{cart.unsubscribe}} has been added for email templates. This merge tag allows user to stop receiving further abandoned cart reminder email notifications. This merge tag has been added to comply with email sending laws in different countries.

* Bugs Fixed - Earlier if any user came from abandoned cart reminder email and place the order using PayPal payment gateway and do not reach the order received page. Then plugin was not considering that order as a recovered order. From now onwards if the user came from the abandoned cart reminder email and place the order using PayPal and does not reach the order received the page. Then plugin will consider that cart as a recovered order.

* Bugs Fixed - When the cart is abandoned as a guest & product have the special character in the attributes name, then it was displaying a blank row with only a checkbox on the Abandoned Orders tab. This has been fixed.

* Tweak - If the order is recovered from the abandoned cart reminder email then it will add a note "This order was abandoned & subsequently recovered." for the order.

= 2.8 (18.05.2016) =

* We have changed the encryption for the links that are sent in the Abandoned cart email notifications. Earlier we were using the mcrypt library for encoding the data. If mcrypt library was not installed on the server, then abandoned cart email notifications were not sent. Now we have used different functions for encoding the string. We have used microtime function & a security key. Using this security key, and after applying an algorithm on it, we generate the encoded string.

* The session now starts only on required pages of the store. Earlier it was started globally. This will help to improve the site performance.

* If billing email address of the logged-in user is not set then it was showing blank space on the abandoned orders list. This has been fixed. Now it will show the email address which was used while registering to the store.

* Earlier if email body was blank and we send the test email then blank email was sent. This has been fixed. Now if email body is blank then test email will not be sent.

* Tweak - Earlier we were populating the guest cart information by looping into the global WooCommerce cart. Now we are not looping & instead using the WooCommerce session object itself.

* Tweak - Earlier if the 'wp-content' directory has been renamed, then wp-load.php file was not included and abandoned cart reminder email was not sent.  Now, we have changed the way of including the wp-load.php file for sending the abandoned cart reminder notifications.

* Tweak - Earlier when {{products.cart}} merge tag is used in abandoned cart email template, then on click of the product name and product image, it was redirecting to the product page. Now it will redirect the user to the cart page.

* Tweak - We are now rounding off the prices with the 'round' function.

= 2.7 (14.04.2016) =

* New setting named as "Email Template Header Text" is added in Add / Edit template page. It will allow to change the header text of the email which have WooCommerce template style setting enabled for the template.

* From this version, the email sending process will run every 15 minutes instead of every 5 minutes. This will result in improved overall performance of the website.

* The Settings page for the plugin has been redone. We are now using the WordPress Settings API for all the options on that page.
* When the plugin is installed & activated for the first time, 1 default email template will also be created. The template will be inactive when the plugin is activated.
* A new setting is added on the Add/Edit Template page named as "Active". If this setting is checked, only then the abandoned cart reminder email will be sent to the customers. If this setting is unchecked, then the email template won't be sent to the customers, but still you can keep it in the plugin. By default, this is unchecked.
* A new setting is added on the Add/Edit Template page named as "Use WooCommerce Template Style". If this setting is checked then abandoned cart reminder email will use the WooCommerce style (header, footer, background, etc.) for the notifications. If it is not checked then the regular email will be sent to the customer as per the formatting that is set in the template editor.
For existing users, this setting will remain unchecked. For new users of the plugin, the setting will be enabled for the existing default email template that is provided with the plugin.
